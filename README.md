# RussianRoulette
A console based Russian Roulette game

With a little to much free time at hand, silly items like this gets created. 
This "game" is in fact just a bunch of random generated settings, giving you the randomness of a Russian Roulette game. 

An infinite amount of players can participate, though, probably a max of six players would seems logic given that the revovler used is a six-shooter, leaving a max of 6 rounds.

You decide the amount of bullets to load in the chamber. Well, within the laws of physics that is, so a max of 6 bullets in our six-shooter.
The bullets will be loaded randomly in the chamber.

### Happy Triggering!
